# MonkeyPen
MonkeyPen is a mobile app which uses Drupal 7 as Back End

### Why i go for this?
I wanted to make use of the content management capabilities of [Drupal](https://drupal.org) in the same time enjoy the performance of Node.Js. And yes it is a **Headless Druapl** concept.

> In short, with Headless Drupal, a visitor to the website will not
> interact with Drupal directly.

### Why i didn't used Drupal 8?
Drupal is not yet stabilised as of Oct 27,  also there are limited modules available.
